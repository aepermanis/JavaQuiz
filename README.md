# JavaQuiz

## Description

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

## Usage

When Start Quiz is pressed questions will populate on the screen and a timer will start. Click on the buttons with answers until time runs out or you complete the quiz. If you fail a try again a button will appear to allow you to try again. If you succeed you can save your records. Clicking view highscores brings up all saved scores.
